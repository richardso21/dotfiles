# Welcome to my (richardso21's) dotfiles
You'll be dissapointed to see I have no use for polybar or fancy theming (yet). My setup is optimized for my workflow, while looking decent enough that my eyes don't melt.

**I USE W,A,S,D** _(not HJKL or JKL;)_ **FOR i3 MOVEMENT.** C'mon, you can move windows with just ONE hand, how great is that? _Before you ask, no, I don't use WASD for vim._

## Dependencies (Stuff I use)
 - i3-gaps (gaps for the win)
   - i3lock-fancy (lock screen)
   - i3status/i3blocks (bar display)
   - autotiling (bspwm-like tiling)
   - playerctl (controlling media controls)
   - pulseaudio-ctl (controlling volume controls)
   - feh (wallpaper)
 - picom (screen tearing & nicer looks)
 - dunst (minimal notifs)
 - rofi + adi1090x/rofi (app menu)
 - Alacritty (terminal)
 - Numix Circle Icons
 - Flat Remix GTK Blue Darkest (gtk theme; in case you didn't know, blue's my favorite color)
 - San Francisco (SFNS) Display Font
 - Redshift (blue light filter)

## Important Information
I use arch btw
