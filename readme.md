# Welcome to my (richardso21's) dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for my linux setup (i3-gaps, zsh, etc.). You'll be dissapointed to see I have no use for polybar or fancy theming (yet). This setup is optimized for my own workflow, while looking decent enough that it wont't melt eyes.

**_NOTE_: I USE W,A,S,D** _(not HJKL or JKL;)_ **FOR i3 MOVEMENT.** It's just my personal preference.

## Dependencies (Stuff I use)
 - i3-gaps (gaps for the win)
   - i3lock-fancy (lock screen)
   - i3status/i3blocks (bar display)
   - autotiling (bspwm-like tiling)
   - playerctl (controlling media controls)
   - pulseaudio-ctl (controlling volume controls)
   - feh (wallpaper)
 - picom (screen tearing & nicer looks)
 - dunst (minimal notifs)
 - rofi + adi1090x/rofi (app menu)
 - zsh (terminal)
   - Alacritty (terminal emulator)
   - powerlevel10k (theme)
   - zsh autocomplete/syntax highlighting
 - Numix Circle Icons
 - Flat Remix GTK Blue Darkest (gtk theme; in case you didn't know, blue's my favorite color)
 - San Francisco (SFNS) Display Font
 - Redshift (blue light filter)

## Important Information
I use arch btw
